function [X, Z] = ekf2(sensor, varargin)
% EKF2 Extended Kalman Filter with IMU as inputs
%
% INPUTS:
%   sensor - struct stored in provided dataset, fields include
%          - is_ready: logical, indicates whether sensor data is valid
%          - t: sensor timestamp
%          - rpy, omg, acc: imu readings
%          - img: uint8, 240x376 grayscale image
%          - id: 1xn ids of detected tags
%          - p0, p1, p2, p3, p4: 2xn pixel position of center and
%                                four corners of detected tags
%            Y
%            ^ P3 == P2
%            | || P0 ||
%            | P4 == P1
%            o---------> X
%   varargin - any variables you wish to pass into the function, could be
%              a data structure to represent the map or camera parameters,
%              your decision. But for the purpose of testing, since we don't
%              know what inputs you will use, you have to specify them in
%              init_script by doing
%              ekf1_handle = ...
%                  @(sensor) ekf2(sensor, your input arguments);
%
% OUTPUTS:
% X - nx1 state of the quadrotor, n should be greater or equal to 9
%     the state should be in the following order
%     [x; y; z; vx; vy; vz; roll; pitch; yaw; other states you use]
%     we will only take the first 9 rows of X
% OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
% Z - mx1 measurement of your pose estimator, m shoulb be greater or equal to 6
%     the measurement should be in the following order
%     [x; y; z; roll; pitch; yaw; other measurement you use]
%     note that this output is optional, it's here in case you want to log your
%     measurement 

X = zeros(9,1);
Z = zeros(6,1);
